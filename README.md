# Model-Registry-

Development of a model registry storing in cloud pretrained ML models (CNN and MLP).

A Model Registry is a repository to store and manage trained ML models.  
Model Registries generally comprise the following components: 
  - object storage to hold model files (e.g., tflite);
  - model monitoring to monitor the model predictions on new data;
  - a programmatic API that enables users to interact with the registry.
